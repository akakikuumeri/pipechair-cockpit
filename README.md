# Akaki Pipe Chair Cockpit
3D printable flight stick and pedals with minimal hardware. Great for Condor 2 and other VR gliding simulators.

![3D render](pipechair%20cockpit%20render.png?raw=true)

Features a robust joystick gimbal that only needs 608 "skate" bearings and no other hardware. Instead of metal bolts, it uses 3D printed dowels.

The frame and the stick shaft are 18 mm PVC pipe. The whole device clips onto a pipe chair.

The stick head is styled like a glider stick.

Stick motion is sensed with either bare Hall effect sensor components, or TLE5010/11 digital magnetoresistive sensors. Other axes are sensed with the common potentiometer. I recommend the MMJoy2 firmware and an Arduino Micro to manage the USB device.
